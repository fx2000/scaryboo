Scary Boo Inc Landing Page

## Description

This is a result of a one-day hackathon at Ironhack. Our proposal is based on a landing page for our client: Scary Boo and its event for Halloween.

We have create a landing page for a campaign that they will run on social networks. The landing page will have:

1. Primary Headline: Halloween Terrific Party
2. Unique Value Proposition (UPV) The party information is written in 2 cards with the next information: D.J:, Price, location (), day and time, and information about a costume contest.
3. A form with fields: Name, email and phone with a CTA button (Signup).
